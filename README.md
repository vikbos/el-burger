# Project Info
This project was created with create-react-app, then ejected. I am aware of this project setup being quite deprecated. I will upgrade it once i have time.

# Setup and Use
- clone project
- npm start
- sign up (if you want to create an account, in that case input some fake credentials!) || if you don't want to sign up, sign in with email: testacc@test.com and password: 123456
- click around and see what it does :-)
